# FISH-WEIGHT-ESTIMATION-ML
MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL FOR WEIGHT ESTIMATION FROM MEASUREMENTS OF THE FISH.

The aim of this case study is to estimate weight of the fish individuals from their measurements Through using linear regression model.
This study can be improved to use in fish farms.
Individual fish swimming in front of the camera can be measured from the video image and the weight of the fish can be estimated through the linear regression model.
